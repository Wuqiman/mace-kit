Introduction
=============

MACE-Kit integrates several deep learning models ready to use, using MACE
as the computing engine. It aims to provide basic functions on aspects of
computer vision, natural language processing and speech processing. However,
by this time, we have only open sourced limited part of them. Hopefully, we
could provide more to developers in the near future.

The algorithms we have already integrated are listed as follows:

* Face Detection

* Face Recognition

* Automatic Speech Recognition
